<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Professor van Dijk's lab at Yale University whose work lies at the intersection of large language models, deep learning, and intelligent agent systems. I earned my M.S. from Columbia University and hold a B.Sc. in Statistics from the University of British Columbia (Canada), with a strong foundation in data-driven discovery. 

My research focuses on developing foundation models and AI agents to tackle complex biological challenges. I am passionate about applying these approaches to biological data while collaborating across disciplines to push the boundaries of AI in biology.

I am always interested in discussing new ideas and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email!
